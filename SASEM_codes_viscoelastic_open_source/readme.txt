1. "run_4_layered_model.m" calculates the normal modes of the 4-layered model.

2. "run_offshore_gradient_model.m" calculates the normal modes of the offshore model.

3. "run_LVL_model.m" calculates the normal modes of the model with a low-velocity layer.

4. "run_backpropagation_wave_model.m" calculated the normal modes of the 2-layered model with a strong interface.
